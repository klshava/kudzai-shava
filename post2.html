To cut the long story short, <i> sometimes your job application gets rejected even before a human being looks at it!</i>
Most companies are using automated algorithms to screen their candidates in 
what is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system">Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</a>. 
These systems are designed to make the work of the recruitment team much easier by quickly sorting applications and rejecting those that
do not meet their ideal or desired characteristics. Although this makes it easier for a recruitment
consultant that was supposed to be scanning through 2000 applications for a role, it may be
biased and unfair. I'm not going to be teaching you how to beat the system!
I will be talking about the biases and unfairness that these systems exhibit
</p>
<p>
The Applicant Tracking System takes all the applicant’s information from their submitted
documentation including filled out forms, resumes, and cover letters and turns it into a basic
standard format. This format is then compared to the job description and required traits using
keywords to identify if the candidate is the right match for the job.
About 75 percent of the companies have now begun the use of Applicant Tracking Systems. The
applicants are required to create a profile on the recruiting company’s careers website. The first
step in doing this is signing up with at least a name, email, and password. In the account, the
applicants are then required to provide more details about themselves. The most common of
these details being information about their gender, ethnicity, citizenship, languages, and of
course experience and qualifications. Also, the user is allowed to attach other resumes or links to
professional websites like LinkedIn for more information. All of which, could be used as a factor
to decide whether the application lands in the “yes” pile or the “no” pile. With the algorithm in
ATS, this process happens in seconds and one can be rejected before a human being even looks
at the application.
</p>

<p>
For one to come up with an algorithm, they require two things: an input data set and a success
criterion. We can hence think of an algorithm as the black box system that takes in inputs from
one end, processes them using whatever instructions are stored in the black box, and gives output
on the other end. In the case of the recruitment process, the input data set will be the applicant’s
documentation. The success criterion is then chosen by the recruiting company. They may
choose to try to match the entry-level skills of an employee that has been outstanding in their
role at the company. While this sounds reasonable and probable, the companies may choose to
set even more filters with certain variables they require.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the company might say they require someone that has knowledge and experience
working with JavaScript and HTML. Which, frankly, is still reasonable as this is what the
position being advertised requires. The problem arises when the success criterion uses
discriminatory filters. This may not be as explicit as using gender for instance; not to say that this 
may not happen also(Paranoia 101? Who knows). We need to remember that what’s in the black box (success criterion) is
hidden from people. This, however, may include using algorithms that have been trained using
biased data sets. For instance, all the data input fed in the algorithm during the testing process for
the role of a manager consisted of only male candidates. This means in the actual application of
the algorithm; it will only look for male candidates by for instance using the name provided.
</p>

	
<p>
The names not only present bias in terms of sex, but also presents a bias in terms of race. Think
of how an algorithm trained using names of white males may not be able to pick up names in
African or Asian indigenous languages. The algorithm may flag such applications as containing
insufficient information due to a missing name. The effect of such a filter is that the algorithm
will reject people who would have been the ideal candidates for the role. This may not have been
an intended outcome in creating the algorithm but because a narrow data set was used to train the
algorithm. Such can be thought of as unconscious bias. Unconscious bias also happens with
human beings however, the likelihood of it happening more times is very slim in comparison
with a fixed algorithm. In such a case, this shows how the status quo can be automated by an
algorithm. This can go on unnoticed for a long time while people think a certain group of people
are always better candidates for jobs at the company.
</p>
<p>
Some of the things may sound a little facetious and require much deeper thought to be able to
pinpoint at the issues. An example could be how a simple address could be used to
subconsciously and residentially segregate a certain group of people in society. In a society built
on historic socio-economic and racial injustices, it is evident that different areas have different
demographics. In most cases, if you know where someone stays, or merely their zip code, you
may not even need to ask about their race. Hence a company’s hiring process may easily become
racially discriminating because of the zip codes that the system is familiar with. Such a bias can
easily and subconsciously be incorporated into algorithms and can cause deeper problems in the
long run.
</p>
<p>
In the case that a company uses a biased ATS algorithm as discussed above, the algorithm will
continue to repeat past unfair, exclusionary, and discriminatory practices. This will result in
severe segregation in the workplace. The managerial positions will always be occupied by males
while positions like Receptionists or Recruitment by females. Then there will also be companies 
hiring only Africans while others hire only Asians. The use of algorithms is an activity that
should be closely monitored. This is because algorithms do not have the embedded ethics that
humans have. To make matters worse these algorithms are made privately and are not audited,
this gives the companies responsible private power.
</p>
<p>
Another shortfall of the algorithms used in ATS is that it looks specifically into the skills that are
required by a role. So many companies can benefit from hiring people with skills from a
different industry as they bring fresh new perspectives and skills that the company may need.
The algorithm is not capable of making such decisions. It is awful in the evaluation of recent
graduates as most of these candidates do not have the required experience. Thus, it disqualifies a
big bunch of extremely talented individuals based on not finding the keywords. While still at the
issue of keywords another disadvantage comes to mind. The ATS system and its selection
algorithm are prone to manipulation. Applicants that carefully study the system and its algorithm
can easily beat it by stuffing their application with the right keywords for the role even if they are
not qualified for the role. This can be detrimental for the hiring company as well as other
deserving candidates.
</p>

<p>
I dont intend to say dont put your name or address on your CV. I'm only trying to make you aware of 
whats happening free of charge! All I've mentioned is only a piece of the cake. 
It is up to you to now to educate yourself better on such systems and maybe provide yourself with answers on why you have not been getting the job calls.
