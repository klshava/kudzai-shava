The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about drastic changes in people’s way of life, all over the
world. As a precautionary measure to cub the spread of this highly contagious coronavirus, world
governments have decided to turn to cell phone tracking. Although this approach provides
solutions such as contact tracing and quarantine enforcement, it also raises consequential
concerns about human rights. Cellphone tracking is one of the systems that fall into what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff" target="_blank">Shoshana Zuboff</a> describes as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism" target="blank">Surveillance Capitalism</a>. Cellphone tracking is a data driven
technological solution that has potential to give away more detail than the user had intended to
disclose. In this age of social and economic power-hungry technology platforms and no law
obstructing the commodifying and trade of personal data, this technological solution by
governments is highly questionable and posing risks to people’s privacy and more frightening, to
democracy.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697" target="_blank">Shoshana Zuboff’s work on Surveillance Capitalism</a> tries to prove that these technological power
houses initially enter the scene as providers of convenience and private experience. They portray
their services as the inevitable outgrowth of technology. However, in the background, not easily
seen to common eye, these services they provide, steal rich, valuable and predictive signals about
our identity, activities, associations and most importantly in this case, location. These signals are
turned into data that is fed into artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms which in
turn predict, with high certainty, our behaviors. This magical surveillance,
providing behavioral insight, is then sold off to interested parties, be it businesses or political
parties, for a dividend. The human need for safety and convenience is exploited and sold to
systems that are conveniently and intentionally hidden from us.
</p>
<p>
When a Democratic government chooses to track the location of its citizens, a lot may happen,
including human rights infringements if effective measures are not put in place to preserve the
privacy of the people. Most of the technological houses that provide these tracking services are
privately owned companies that people have trusted, blindly, with their information. Since these 
companies’ use of this information is not bound by any law, most of them use it to accomplish
certain commercial outcomes for their customers. People are essentially given two choices: to be
non-existent in the digital world or to be under surveillance and therefore face the consequences
of it. Government enforcing cell phone tracking means taking away the first choice and dropping
every citizen into the ocean congested with these dividend driven sharks unimpeded by the law.
People can no longer be where they want to be without third parties knowing who they are,
where they are, who they are with and what they are doing. This is very sensitive information
and will result in unforeseen ruin if it lands in the wrong hands. An article by Justin Scheck,
titled, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467304575383522318244234" target="_blank">“Stalkers Exploit Cellphone GPS”</a>, published by the Wall Street Journal gives multiple
examples of offenders that found their victims using cellphone tracking. Of these, one of interest
was the lady who ran away from her abusive and violent husband to secretly stay with a friend,
only for the husband to later find her using GPS cell phone tracking, an hour later, without her
permission or knowledge thereof. The husband had been paying a cheap yearly fee to his wife’s
mobile network provider in order to be able to track her live location for as long as her phone
was powered on.
</p>
<p>
It is not known to what extent the government collects and reuses the information they will
obtain from cellphone tracking. According to Shoshana Zuboff, the whole system is built in such
a manner that they know all about us and we know little to nothing about them. Also, we are in a
century in time where power belongs to those that have the data/information. This means that
they may decide to keep the data collected and reuse it beyond the initially stated purpose of
disease surveillance. The first and now least of the citizen’s worries is when these Capitalists sell
people’s personal information to business’s for targeted advertising. The bigger worry is when
the same perpetrators use people’s information to influence their behaviors and decisions.
The telecommunications or technology companies tasked with the duty to collect location
information from people may sell this information to businesses at the end of the COVID-19
period. The recipients of this information can use it to influence people to do things or make 
decisions that will solely profit them and their organizations. This might entail buying certain
things, visiting certain places or even voting for a certain political party. This is exactly how
Surveillance Capitalism begins to undermine Democracy. It is a form of digital brainwashing
where people do not necessarily have their freedom of choice taken away, however, being
exposed to very similar adverts all the time influences people to buy into them. There have been
so many reports of companies like Facebook or Google selling their platform users information
to companies like Cambridge Analytica or insurance companies who use this database to drive
people in a certain direction.
</p>
<p>
An application called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/coronavirus-china-health-software-color-coded-how-it-works-2020-4?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank"> Health Code </a>is being utilized by China.  The
application assigns each user with a color between green, yellow and red. Checkpoints have been
placed in different public spaces such that one needs to scan a QR code upon entrance. The
green color allows someone to move around freely, the yellow requires someone to self-isolate
for a week and the red requires two weeks of quarantine. Such an application uses cellphone
tracking to monitor whether a flagged person has indeed served their time or not. The issues
arising from its usage is that its criteria for flagging people as red or yellow has not been
communicated. Since all public services are requiring people to have this application in order to
do stuff, people have no choice but to discard their privacy worries so life can continue.
Cellphone tracking can be done in more than three ways. These ways include the use of the
Global Positioning System, cellphone tower pings and Bluetooth connections. The effects of cellphone tracking are all dependent on the implementation of it. It
has been said that countries like Austria, Italy and Germany have asked their mobile carriers to
share data about their citizens whilst still obeying European privacy law. This is because they
track masses rather than individuals and the data they obtain from the tracking activities, is said
to be anonymized. Their approach is said to be less invasive than the South Korean and Chinese
government’s. This is because the latter governments are using smartphone location tracking,
credit cards tracking and CCTV footage with facial recognition capabilities. In
extreme cases, some countries are requesting the telecommunication companies to provide them 
with user call and text messages, as well the time and location details of when they were made or
sent.
</p>
<p>
If governments took the approach that the European countries are taking, then cellphone tracking
could really be useful in trying to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The first step in this is having
law that regulates the usage of people’s data like the European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation. The information collected remains anonymous and aggregated whilst at the same
time being useful in monitoring the observation of rules by the population. These data protection
acts usually state that the use of the data should be time limited and focused on a cause that
benefits humanity.  The other most crucial step is letting people
know that they are being tracked for a particular reason, what information is being collected
about them, how it will be used and for how long it will be collected and used. In short, such a
move requires transparency.
</p>
<p>
The collected information should only be location information in the case that it is used for
contact tracing. This means that if a person has tested positive for the corona virus, their past
movements should be revisited using cellphone location information. Those people who the
person has been in close contact with should be located, tested and possibly isolated. The cell
phone tracking information can then be used to ensure that the identified people are really
isolating themselves and staying far away as possible from public spaces. There have been cases
where infected people intentionally go around spreading the virus by, for example, spitting on
people’s car door handles. (Hope, 2020) Tracking would be useful in monitoring people with
such behavior. Location data can also be analyzed in aggregate form and this approach is useful
in identifying the behavior and movement of people in order to distribute medical resources
quicker and more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
Another slightly safe approach that could be taken is making use of the Bluetooth based contact
tracing applications like the government of Singapore has implemented.  Only infected persons are required to download this application. Its information is stored 
in the user’s phone in an encrypted form. Users are then requested to upload the data to the
health ministry, which can then decrypt the data and use it for mapping out their interactions and
movements. With this implementation, it should also be noted what permissions are given to the
application. The application should only be allowed to monitor location and its access to the
camera, microphone and things like contacts restricted. Measures should also be put in place to
safeguard the data at the central data storage facility from hackers.
</p>
<p>
With all said, it can be noted that the privacy violations that come with cellphone tracking are
humongous and significant. The information obtained from this surveillance can be used for
contact tracing or repression, for enforcing self-isolation or for targeted advertising. The
possibilities are endless especially when the purpose of the surveillance is not clearly stated. The
tracking programs can easily outlast their intended use. Governments should therefore not
approve any of these cellphone tracking technologies until they have careful put up policies that
will see to it that human rights are not violated in the process
